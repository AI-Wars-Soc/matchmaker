# Matchmaker

The middle man between the submission runner and the database, to prevent the submission runner from being able to be taken over to access the database. Essentially an air gap which repeatedly finds submissions which can be run and asks the submission runner to run them over HTTP. Collects the results of the game, saves them, and starts again
